## An investigation into the scattering dynamics of cavitons in a saturating nonlinear Schr√∂dinger equation.
This repository contains the reports and code I wrote during my time working on this project as an undergraduate researcher at Boston University.

# History
A long time ago Fred Tappert was running some simulations on a model for laser interactions in plasma. The model
is a nonlinear schrodinger type equation with a gussian nonlinearity. During these numerical simulations he observed an example of two cavitons colliding head on and seemingly scattering at 90 degrees to their original orientation.
Decades later David Campbell would show these tapes to me in seminar class he was teaching on nonlinear dynamics and chaos, and together with Ryan Goh, we formed a group to attempt to verify the existance of the 90 degree scattering and to make a concrete investigation of the dynamics of the pulses that form in this system.
# Cavitons and collision dynamics in one dimension
We have thouroughly studied the cavtitons that form in one dimension and the dynamics of their collisions. The report is in the late stages of reveiw and will be available soon

# Verification of 90 degree scattering
Recently, after months of searching, I was able to find an example of 90 degree scattering. Further explanation to come.
